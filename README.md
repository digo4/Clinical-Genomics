Clinical genomics analysis refers to the application of genomic technologies and computational methods to understand the genetic basis of diseases and inform clinical decision-making. It involves the analysis of genomic data obtained from patients to identify genetic variations, mutations, and other molecular features that may contribute to disease development or progression. The goal is to use this information to guide diagnosis, treatment decisions, and personalized medicine approaches.
